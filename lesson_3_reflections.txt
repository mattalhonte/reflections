My notes:

View remote branches:
git remote


Add remote repository:
git remote add <name you want to use> <url of repository you created>


View name & URL for the repository you're going to fetch from and that you're going to push to:
git remote -v


Send committed changes to repository:
git push


Their stuff:

When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
