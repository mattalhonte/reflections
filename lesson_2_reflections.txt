My notes:


Have git start tracking current directory:
git init


Check git status of current directory:
git status


Add a file to the "staging area" - to eventually commit:
git add <filename>


Reset staging area:
git reset


Commit the changes in the staging area:
git commit


Made notepad++ my default editor:

Their Questions:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
This makes the folder a git repository - there will be a hidden directory that will track changes.  If you don't do that, git won't track the changes.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area lets you organize your edits across multiple files before making a commit.  It lets you combine multiple files, and gives another shot at spotting errors.
